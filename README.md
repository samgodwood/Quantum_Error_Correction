# Quantum Error Correction Simulation

This repository contains code and resources for simulating quantum error-correcting codes.

## Project Structure

- `3qubit_code/Basic 3 qubit code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the simulation code for the 3-qubit bit flip code for simple bit flip errors. The simulation is carried out using linear algebra with numpy, and the results are visualized to understand the performance of the error correction code against random bit flip errors.

- `3qubit_code/3 Qubit Code with Relaxation Errors.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook building upon the functions defined in `3qubit_code/Basic 3 qubit code.ipynb`. This notebook focuses on simulating relaxation errors (T_1 errors) and plots the lifetime of physical qubits vs. logical qubits. Accompanied by `3qubit_code/relaxation3qubitcode.py`, which includes functions used in the notebook.

- `3qubit_code/3 Qubit Code with Depolarization Errors.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook building upon the functions defined in `3qubit_code/Basic 3 qubit code.ipynb`. This notebook focuses on simulating depolarization errors and simulates the average fidelity of the logical qubit over cycles. Accompanied by `3qubit_code/depolarization3qubitcode.py`, which includes functions used in the notebook.

- `Surface_Code/Surface Code Introduction.ipynb`: Utilizing qiskit, a Jupyter notebook containing an introduction to the Surface Code. Starting with the basic concepts of X and Z stabilizer measurements, and then introducing the 7-qubit error detection Surface Code (distance = 2).

- `Bosonic_Modes/GKP code.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that provides a brief introduction to Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes and their application in quantum error correction. This notebook demonstrates how GKP codes can be used for error correction in bosonic modes.
